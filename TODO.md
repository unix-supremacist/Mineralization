##Armor/Tools
flint
copper
monel
electrum (slightly stronger gold armor that works for piglins)
jade
cobalt (smithed from jade)
enderium (smithed from cobalt) slightly beefed cobalt that enderman will ignore you staring at them
shulker (smithed from enderium)
infinity (smithed from shulker) (uses an infinity singularity, basically avaritia)

##ore processing
###random note for tin to be able to check byproduct1 is iron, 2 is zinc
Ore (Macerates to 2 Raw Ore with a 2 tiny dust byproduct(1))
Raw Ore (Macerates 2 to 2 crushed ore, with a 2 tiny dust byproduct(1)
Crushed Ore(Centrifuges to 1 purified ore, 1 tiny dust byproduct(2)) (purified to 1 purified ore, 2 tiny dust byproduct(1)) (macerates to 1 dirty dust, 1 tiny dust byproduct(1)) (chemical bath to 1 purified ore, 7 tiny dust byproduct(2)) (sluices to 1 purified, 4 tiny dust byproduct(1))
Purified Ore(Centrifuges to 1 refined ore, 1 tiny dust byproduct(2)) (macerates to 1 purified dust, 1 tiny dust byproduct(2)) (sifts to refined ore, 1 tiny dust byproduct(1))
Refined Ore(macerates to 12 tiny dust, 1 tiny dust byproduct(2))
Dirty Dust(Centrifuges to 10 tiny dust, 1 tiny dust byproduct(1)) (sifts to 10 tiny dust, 1 tiny dust byproduct(2))
Purified Dust(Centrifuges to 10 tiny dust, 1 tiny dust byproduct(2)) (electromagnetic separation to 10 tiny dust, 7 iron tiny dust if applicable)
Dust (roasts to sub dusts if applicable)

##Parts
Rods
Wafer?
Coil?
Tiny Dust
Singularity

##tools
file
paxel
hammer
excavator
shears?
maybe gate of babylon compat

##ores
cobaltite
jadeite
garnierite
galena
silver/lead for compat??? maybe only load if MI is loaded
platinum as a nickel byproduct and sheldonite ore rarely in the end
